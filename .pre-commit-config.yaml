        # Unfortunately, `pre-commit` only runs on changed files
        # This doesn't work well with `mypy --follow-imports error`
        # See: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy/issues/34#issuecomment-1062160321
        #
        # To workaround this we run `mypy` only in manual mode
        # So it won't run as part of `git commit` command
        # But it will still be run as part of `pre-commit` workflow and give expected results
