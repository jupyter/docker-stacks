          - With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning.
          - Altair's API is simple, friendly, and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar.
          - This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.
