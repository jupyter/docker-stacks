          - Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite, and the source is available on GitHub.
          - With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning.
          - Altair's API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar.
          - This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.
