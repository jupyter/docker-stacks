## Basic Use

The following command starts a container with the Notebook server listening for HTTP connections on port 8888 without authentication configured.

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook
```

## Using Spark Local Mode

This configuration is nice for using Spark on small, local data.

### In a Python Notebook

0. Run the container as shown above.
1. Open a Python 2 or 3 notebook.
2. Create a `SparkContext` configured for local mode.

For example, the first few cells in a notebook might read:

```python
import pyspark
sc = pyspark.SparkContext('local[*]')

# do something to prove it works
rdd = sc.parallelize(range(1000))
rdd.takeSample(False, 5)
```

### In a R Notebook

0. Run the container as shown above.
1. Open a R notebook.
2. Initialize `sparkR` for local mode.
3. Initialize `sparkRSQL`.

For example, the first few cells in a R notebook might read:

```
library(SparkR)

sc <- sparkR.init("local[*]")
sqlContext <- sparkRSQL.init(sc)

# do something to prove it works
data(iris)
df <- createDataFrame(sqlContext, iris)
head(filter(df, df$Petal_Width > 0.2))
```

### In an Apache Toree (Scala) Notebook

0. Run the container as shown above.
1. Open an Apache Toree (Scala) notebook.
2. Use the pre-configured `SparkContext` in variable `sc`.

For example:

```
val rdd = sc.parallelize(0 to 999)
rdd.takeSample(false, 5)
```

## Connecting to a Spark Cluster on Mesos

This configuration allows your compute cluster to scale with your data.

0. [Deploy Spark on Mesos](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-mesos.html).
1. Configure each slave with [the `--no-switch_user` flag](https://open.mesosphere.com/reference/mesos-slave/) or create the `jovyan` user on every slave node.
2. Run the Docker container with `--net=host` in a location that is network addressable by all of your Spark workers. (This is a [Spark networking requirement](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html#components).)
    * NOTE: When using `--net=host`, you must also use the flags `--pid=host -e TINI_SUBREAPER=true`. See https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/64 for details.
3. Follow the language specific instructions below.

### In a Python Notebook

0. Open a Python 2 or 3 notebook.
1. Create a `SparkConf` instance in a new notebook pointing to your Mesos master node (or Zookeeper instance) and Spark binary package location.
2. Create a `SparkContext` using this configuration.

For example, the first few cells in a Python 3 notebook might read:

```python
import os
# make sure pyspark tells workers to use python3 not 2 if both are installed
os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = '/usr/bin/python3'

import pyspark
conf = pyspark.SparkConf()

# point to mesos master or zookeeper entry (e.g., zk://10.10.10.10:2181/mesos)
conf.setMaster("mesos://10.10.10.10:5050")
# point to spark binary package in HDFS or on local filesystem on all slave
# nodes (e.g., file:///opt/spark/spark-1.6.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz)
conf.set("spark.executor.uri", "hdfs://10.10.10.10/spark/spark-1.6.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz")
# set other options as desired
conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "8g")
conf.set("spark.core.connection.ack.wait.timeout", "1200")

# create the context
sc = pyspark.SparkContext(conf=conf)

# do something to prove it works
rdd = sc.parallelize(range(100000000))
rdd.sumApprox(3)
```

To use Python 2 in the notebook and on the workers, change the `PYSPARK_PYTHON` environment variable to point to the location of the Python 2.x interpreter binary. If you leave this environment variable unset, it defaults to `python`.

Of course, all of this can be hidden in an [IPython kernel startup script](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/development/config.html?highlight=startup#startup-files), but "explicit is better than implicit." :)

### In a R Notebook

0. Run the container as shown above.
1. Open a R notebook.
2. Initialize `sparkR` Mesos master node (or Zookeeper instance) and Spark binary package location.
3. Initialize `sparkRSQL`.

For example, the first few cells in a R notebook might read:

```
library(SparkR)

# point to mesos master or zookeeper entry (e.g., zk://10.10.10.10:2181/mesos)\
# as the first argument
# point to spark binary package in HDFS or on local filesystem on all slave
# nodes (e.g., file:///opt/spark/spark-1.6.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz) in sparkEnvir
# set other options in sparkEnvir
sc <- sparkR.init("mesos://10.10.10.10:5050", sparkEnvir=list(
    spark.executor.uri="hdfs://10.10.10.10/spark/spark-1.6.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz",
    spark.executor.memory="8g"
    )
)
sqlContext <- sparkRSQL.init(sc)

# do something to prove it works
data(iris)
df <- createDataFrame(sqlContext, iris)
head(filter(df, df$Petal_Width > 0.2))
```

### In an Apache Toree (Scala) Notebook

0. Open a terminal via *New -> Terminal* in the notebook interface.
1. Add information about your cluster to the `SPARK_OPTS` environment variable when running the container.
2. Open an Apache Toree (Scala) notebook.
3. Use the pre-configured `SparkContext` in variable `sc`.

The Apache Toree kernel automatically creates a `SparkContext` when it starts based on configuration information from its command line arguments and environment variables. You can pass information about your Mesos cluster via the `SPARK_OPTS` environment variable when you spawn a container.

For instance, to pass information about a Mesos master, Spark binary location in HDFS, and an executor options, you could start the container like so:

`docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -e SPARK_OPTS '--master=mesos://10.10.10.10:5050 \
    --spark.executor.uri=hdfs://10.10.10.10/spark/spark-1.6.0-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz \
    --spark.executor.memory=8g' jupyter/all-spark-notebook`

Note that this is the same information expressed in a notebook in the Python case above. Once the kernel spec has your cluster information, you can test your cluster in an Apache Toree notebook like so:

```
// should print the value of --master in the kernel spec
println(sc.master)

// do something to prove it works
val rdd = sc.parallelize(0 to 99999999)
rdd.sum()
```
## Connecting to a Spark Cluster on Standalone Mode

Connection to Spark Cluster on Standalone Mode requires the following set of steps:

0. Verify that the docker image (check the Dockerfile) and the Spark Cluster which is being deployed, run the same version of Spark.
1. [Deploy Spark on Standalone Mode](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html).
2. Run the Docker container with `--net=host` in a location that is network addressable by all of your Spark workers. (This is a [Spark networking requirement](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html#components).)
    * NOTE: When using `--net=host`, you must also use the flags `--pid=host -e TINI_SUBREAPER=true`. See https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/64 for details.
3. The language specific instructions are almost same as mentioned above for Mesos, only the master url would now be something like spark://10.10.10.10:7077

## Notebook Options

You can pass [Jupyter command line options](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#command-line-arguments) through the [`start-notebook.sh` command](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/minimal-notebook/start-notebook.sh#L15) when launching the container. For example, to set the base URL of the notebook server you might do the following:

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.base_url=/some/path
```

You can sidestep the `start-notebook.sh` script entirely by specifying a command other than `start-notebook.sh`. If you do, the `NB_UID` and `GRANT_SUDO` features documented below will not work. See the Docker Options section for details.

## Docker Options

You may customize the execution of the Docker container and the Notebook server it contains with the following optional arguments.

* `-e PASSWORD="YOURPASS"` - Configures Jupyter Notebook to require the given password. Should be conbined with `USE_HTTPS` on untrusted networks.
* `-e USE_HTTPS=yes` - Configures Jupyter Notebook to accept encrypted HTTPS connections. If a `pem` file containing a SSL certificate and key is not provided (see below), the container will generate a self-signed certificate for you.
* `-e NB_UID=1000` - Specify the uid of the `jovyan` user. Useful to mount host volumes with specific file ownership. For this option to take effect, you must run the container with `--user root`. (The `start-notebook.sh` script will `su jovyan` after adjusting the user id.)
* `-e GRANT_SUDO=yes` - Gives the `jovyan` user passwordless `sudo` capability. Useful for installing OS packages. For this option to take effect, you must run the container with `--user root`. (The `start-notebook.sh` script will `su jovyan` after adding `jovyan` to sudoers.) **You should only enable `sudo` if you trust the user or if the container is running on an isolated host.**
* `-v /some/host/folder/for/work:/home/jovyan/work` - Host mounts the default working directory on the host to preserve work even when the container is destroyed and recreated (e.g., during an upgrade).
* `-v /some/host/folder/for/server.pem:/home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/notebook.pem` - Mounts a SSL certificate plus key for `USE_HTTPS`. Useful if you have a real certificate for the domain under which you are running the Notebook server.
* `-p 4040:4040` - Opens the port for the [Spark Monitoring and Instrumentation UI](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/monitoring.html). Note every new spark context that is created is put onto an incrementing port (ie. 4040, 4041, 4042, etc.), and it might be necessary to open multiple ports. `docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 -p 4041:4041 jupyter/all-spark-notebook`

## Conda Environments

The default Python 3.x [Conda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) resides in `/opt/conda`. A second Python 2.x Conda environment exists in `/opt/conda/envs/python2`. You can [switch to the python2 environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html#change-environments-activate-deactivate) in a shell by entering the following:

```
source activate python2
```

You can return to the default environment with this command:

```
source deactivate
```

The commands `ipython`, `python`, `pip`, `easy_install`, and `conda` (among others) are available in both environments.


## JupyterHub

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.org) requires a single-user instance of the Jupyter Notebook server per user.   To use this stack with JupyterHub and [DockerSpawner](https://github.com/jupyter/dockerspawner), you must specify the container image name and override the default container run command in your `jupyterhub_config.py`:

```python
# Spawn user containers from this image
c.DockerSpawner.container_image = 'jupyter/all-spark-notebook'

# Have the Spawner override the Docker run command
c.DockerSpawner.extra_create_kwargs.update({
	'command': '/usr/local/bin/start-singleuser.sh'
})
```
