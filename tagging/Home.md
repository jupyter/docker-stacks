## Build History

This is an auto-generated index of information from the build system.
In this index, you can find image tags, links to commits, and build manifests that describe the image.
All the builds are grouped by year and then month.

Note: we only store the last 4500 manifest files because of GitHub limits.
That's why old manifest files might not be available.
If you want to clone this repo and access the Git history, use the following command: `git clone git@github.com:{REPOSITORY}.wiki.git`

In the tables below, each line represents:

- `YYYY-MM`: link to a page with a list of images built
- `Builds`: # of times build workflow finished
- `Images`: # of single platform images pushed
- `Commits`: # of commits made and a GitHub link

<!-- Everything below is auto-generated, all manual changes will be erased -->
<!-- YEAR_MONTHLY_TABLES -->
