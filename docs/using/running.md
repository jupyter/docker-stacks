# Running a Container

Using one of the Jupyter Docker Stacks requires two choices:

1. Which Docker image you wish to use
2. How you wish to start Docker containers from that image

This section provides details about the second.

## Using the Docker CLI

You can launch a local Docker container from the Jupyter Docker Stacks using the [Docker command-line interface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).
There are numerous ways to configure containers using CLI.
The following are some common patterns.

### Example 1

This command pulls the `jupyter/scipy-notebook` image tagged `2023-11-17` from Quay.io if it is not already present on the local host.
It then starts a container running Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend and exposes the server on host port 8888.
The server logs appear in the terminal and include a URL to the server.

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook:2023-11-17

# Entered start.sh with args: jupyter lab

# ...

#     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
#         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
#     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
#         http://eca4aa01751c:8888/lab?token=d4ac9278f5f5388e88097a3a8ebbe9401be206cfa0b83099
#         http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=d4ac9278f5f5388e88097a3a8ebbe9401be206cfa0b83099
```

Pressing `Ctrl-C` twice shuts down the Server but leaves the container intact on disk for later restart or permanent deletion using commands like the following:

```bash
# list containers
docker ps --all
# CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
# eca4aa01751c   quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook:2023-11-17   "tini -g -- start-noâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Exited (0) 5 seconds ago             silly_panini

# start the stopped container
docker start --attach -i eca4aa01751c
# Entered start.sh with args: jupyter lab
# ...

# remove the stopped container
docker rm eca4aa01751c
# eca4aa01751c
```

### Example 2

This command pulls the `jupyter/r-notebook` image tagged `2023-11-17` from Quay.io if it is not already present on the local host.
It then starts a container running Server and exposes the server on host port 10000.
The server logs appear in the terminal and include a URL to the Server but with the internal container port (8888) instead of the correct host port (10000).

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 10000:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work quay.io/jupyter/r-notebook:2023-11-17
```

Pressing `Ctrl-C` twice shuts down the Server and immediately destroys the Docker container.
New files and changes in `~/work` in the container will be preserved.
Any other changes made in the container will be lost.

```{note}
By default, [jupyter's root_dir](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/other/full-config.html) is `/home/jovyan`.
So, new notebooks will be saved there, unless you change the directory in the file browser.

To change the default directory, you will need to specify `ServerApp.root_dir` by adding this line to the previous command: `start-notebook.py --ServerApp.root_dir=/home/jovyan/work`.
```

### Example 3

This command pulls the `jupyter/all-spark-notebook` image currently tagged `latest` from Quay.io if an image tagged `latest` is not already present on the local host.
It then starts a container named `notebook` running a JupyterLab server and exposes the server on a randomly selected port.

```bash
docker run --detach -P --name notebook quay.io/jupyter/all-spark-notebook
```

where:

- `--detach`: will run the container in detached mode

You can also use the following docker commands to see the port and Jupyter Server token:

```bash
# get the random host port assigned to the container port 8888
docker port notebook 8888
# 0.0.0.0:49153
# :::49153

# get the notebook token from the logs
docker logs --tail 3 notebook
    # Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    #     http://878f1a9b4dfa:8888/lab?token=d336fa63c03f064ff15ce7b269cab95b2095786cf9ab2ba3
    #  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=d336fa63c03f064ff15ce7b269cab95b2095786cf9ab2ba3
```

Together, the URL to visit on the host machine to access the server, in this case, is <http://127.0.0.1:49153/lab?token=d336fa63c03f064ff15ce7b269cab95b2095786cf9ab2ba3>.

The container runs in the background until stopped and/or removed by additional Docker commands:

```bash
# stop the container
docker stop notebook
# notebook

# remove the container permanently
docker rm notebook
# notebook
```

## Using the Podman CLI

An alternative to using the Docker CLI is to use the Podman CLI.
Podman is mostly compatible with Docker.

### Podman example

If we use Podman instead of Docker in the situation given in _Example 2_, it will look like this:

The example makes use of rootless Podman; in other words, the Podman command is run from a regular user account.
In a Bash shell, set the shell variables _uid_ and _gid_ to the UID and GID of the user _jovyan_ in the container.

```bash
uid=1000
gid=100
```

Set the shell variables _subuidSize_ and _subgidSize_ to the number of subordinate UIDs and GIDs, respectively.

```bash
subuidSize=$(( $(podman info --format "{{ range .Host.IDMappings.UIDMap }}+{{.Size }}{{end }}" ) - 1 ))
subgidSize=$(( $(podman info --format "{{ range .Host.IDMappings.GIDMap }}+{{.Size }}{{end }}" ) - 1 ))
```

This command pulls the `quay.io/jupyter/r-notebook` image tagged `2023-11-17` from Quay.io if it is not already present on the local host.
It then starts a container running a Jupyter Server with the JupyterLab frontend and exposes the server on host port 10000.
The server logs appear in the terminal and include a URL to the server but with the internal container port (8888) instead of the correct host port (10000).

```bash
podman run -it --rm -p 10000:8888 \
    -v "${PWD}":/home/jovyan/work --user $uid:$gid \
    --uidmap $uid:0:1 --uidmap 0:1:$uid --uidmap $(($uid+1)):$(($uid+1)):$(($subuidSize-$uid)) \
    --gidmap $gid:0:1 --gidmap 0:1:$gid --gidmap $(($gid+1)):$(($gid+1)):$(($subgidSize-$gid)) \
    quay.io/jupyter/r-notebook:2023-11-17
```

```{warning}
The `podman run` options `--uidmap` and `--gidmap` can be used to map the container user _jovyan_ to the regular user on the host when running rootless Podman.
The same Podman command should not be run with sudo (i.e. running rootful Podman)
because then the mapping would map the container user _jovyan_ to the root user on the host.
It's a good security practice to run programs with as few privileges as possible.
```

```{note}
The `podman run` command in the example above maps all subuids and subgids of the user into the container.
That works fine but is actually more than needed.
The `podman run` option `--userns=auto` will, for instance, not be possible to use as long as there are no unused subuids and subgids available.
The example could be improved by investigating more in detail which UIDs and GIDs need to be available in the container and then only map them.
```

Pressing `Ctrl-C` twice shuts down the Server and immediately destroys the Docker container.
New files and changes in `~/work` in the container will be preserved.
Any other changes made in the container will be lost.

## Using Binder

A [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a service that allows you to create and share custom computing environments for projects in version control.
You can use any of the Jupyter Docker Stacks images as a basis for a Binder-compatible Dockerfile.
See the
[docker-stacks example](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/sample_repos.html#using-a-docker-image-from-the-jupyter-docker-stacks-repository) and
[Using a Dockerfile](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dockerfile.html) section in the
[Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for instructions.

## Using JupyterHub

You can configure JupyterHub to launcher Docker containers from the Jupyter Docker Stacks images.
If you've been following the [Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) guide,
see the [Use an existing Docker image](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#choose-and-use-an-existing-docker-image) section for details.
If you have a custom JupyterHub deployment, see the [Picking or building a Docker image](https://jupyterhub-dockerspawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker-image.html)
instructions for the [dockerspawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner) instead.

## Using Other Tools and Services

You can use the Jupyter Docker Stacks with any Docker-compatible technology
(e.g., [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [docker-py](https://github.com/docker/docker-py), or your favorite cloud container service).
See the documentation of the tool, library, or service for details about how to reference, configure, and launch containers from these images.
