## Conda Environments

The default Python 3.x [Conda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) resides in `/opt/conda`. A second Python 2.x Conda environment exists in `/opt/conda/envs/python2`. You can [switch to the python2 environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html#change-environments-activate-deactivate) in a shell by entering the following:

```
source activate python2
```

You can return to the default environment with this command:

```
source deactivate
```

The commands `jupyter`, `ipython`, `python`, `pip`, `easy_install`, and `conda` (among others) are available in both environments. For convenience, you can install packages into either environment regardless of what environment is currently active using commands like the following:

```
# install a package into the python2 environment
pip2 install some-package
conda install -n python2 some-package

# install a package into the default (python 3.x) environment
pip3 install some-package
conda install -n python3 some-package
```
