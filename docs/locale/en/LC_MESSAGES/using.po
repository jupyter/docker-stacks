" from default, i.e. `022`. For example, if setting umask to `002`, new "
"files will be readable and writable by group members instead of just "
"writable by the owner. Wikipedia has a good article about "
"[umask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask). Feel free to read it in "
"order to choose the value that better fits your needs. Default value "
"should fit most situations. Note that `NB_UMASK` when set only applies to"

"home directory is mounted from the host using `-v` as described below. "

"option is useful, however, when you wish to give `$NB_USER` the ability "
