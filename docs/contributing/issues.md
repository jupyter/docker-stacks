# Project Issues

We appreciate you taking the time to report an issue you encountered while using the Jupyter Docker Stacks.
Please review the following guidelines when reporting your problem.

- Please use GitHub's "Report a Vulnerability" button under Security > Advisories on the appropriate repo,
  e.g. [report here for Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/security/advisories).
  You may also send an email to <mailto:security@ipython.org>, but the GitHub reporting system is preferred.
- If you think your problem is unique to the Jupyter Docker Stacks images,
  please search the [jupyter/docker-stacks issue tracker](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20)
  to see if someone else has already reported the same problem.
  If not, please open a [GitHub bug report issue](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
  and provide all the information requested in the issue template.
  Additionally, check the [Troubleshooting Common Problems](../using/troubleshooting.md) page in the documentation before submitting an issue.
- If the issue you're seeing is with one of the open-source libraries included in the Docker images and is reproducible outside the images,
  please file a bug with the appropriate open-source project.
- If you have a general question about how to use the Jupyter Docker Stacks in your environment,
  in conjunction with other tools, customizations, and so on,
  please post your question on the [Jupyter Discourse site](https://discourse.jupyter.org).
