# Project Issues

We appreciate your taking the time to report an issue you encountered using the Jupyter Docker Stacks.
Please review the following guidelines when reporting your problem.

- If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in any of the Jupyter projects included in Jupyter Docker Stacks images,
  please report it to [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org), **not in the issue trackers on GitHub**.
  If you prefer to encrypt your security reports, you can use [this PGP public key](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter.github.io/blob/HEAD/assets/ipython_security.asc).
- If you think your problem is unique to the Jupyter Docker Stacks images,
  please search the [jupyter/docker-stacks issue tracker](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues)
  to see if someone else has already reported the same problem.
  If not, please open a [GitHub bug report issue](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3ABug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml)
  and provide all the information requested in the issue template.
  Additionally, check the [Troubleshooting Common Problems](../using/troubleshooting.md) page in the documentation before submitting an issue.
- If the issue you're seeing is with one of the open-source libraries included in the Docker images and is reproducible outside the images,
  please file a bug with the appropriate open-source project.
- If you have a general question about how to use the Jupyter Docker Stacks in your environment,
  in conjunction with other tools, customizations, and so on,
  please post your question on the [Jupyter Discourse site](https://discourse.jupyter.org).
