# New Recipes

We welcome contributions of [recipes](../using/recipes.md), short examples of using, configuring, or extending the Docker Stacks for inclusion in the documentation site.
Follow the process below to add a new recipe:

1. Open the `docs/using/recipes.md` source file.
2. Add a second-level Markdown heading naming your recipe at the bottom of the file (e.g., `## Add the RISE extension`)
3. Write the body of your recipe under the heading, including whatever command line, Dockerfile, links, etc. you need.
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/wiki/A-step-by-step-guide-on-preparing-and-submitting-a-pull-request) (PR) with your changes.
   Maintainers will respond and work with you to address any formatting or content issues.
