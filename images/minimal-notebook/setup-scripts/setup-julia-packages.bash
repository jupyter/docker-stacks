# If we don't specify what CPUs the precompilation should be done for, it's
# *only* done for the target of the host doing the compilation.  When the
# container runs on a host that's the same architecture, but a *different*
# generation of CPU than what the build host was, the precompilation is useless
# and Julia takes a long long time to start up. This specific multitarget comes
# from https://github.com/JuliaCI/julia-buildkite/blob/70bde73f6cb17d4381b62236fc2d96b1c7acbba7/utilities/build_envs.sh#L20-L76,
# and may need to be updated as new CPU generations come out.
# If the architecture the container runs on is different,
# precompilation may still have to be re-done on first startup - but this
# *should* catch most of the issues.  See
# https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/2015 for more information
