# With IPython >= 6.0.0, all outputs to stdout/stderr are captured.
# It is the case for subprocesses and output of compiled libraries like Spark.
# Those logs now both head to notebook logs and in notebooks outputs.
# Logs are particularly verbose with Spark, that is why we turn them off through this flag.
